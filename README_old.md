# OpenG Dictionary Library

\>> [Install the OpenG Dictionary Library with VIPM](https://www.vipm.io/package/oglib_dictionary/) \<\<

_Note: LabVIEW 2019 introduced the native "Map" data type and related functions, which obviates the need for the OpenG Dictionary Library for new projects in LabVIEW 2019+_

### Overview

The OpenG Dictionary Library package contains a library for key-value sets in LabVIEW. Keys and Values are stored as Variants. You may wish to wrap these VIs with ones that convert the specific data types used in your application.
